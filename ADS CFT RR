Modified AdS/CFT Duality (RR-AdS/CFT):

We defined a modified duality mapping as follows:

    Bulk AdS-like Space (Higher-dimensional):
    Represents the underlying, nonlocal retrocausal influence domain where past and future boundary conditions propagate symmetrically. Dynamics within this bulk domain are fundamentally holographic and inherently nonlocal.

    Boundary CFT-like Theory (Lower-dimensional observable reality):
    Represents conventional physical reality perceived causally, constrained by relativistic causality and local observations.

RR-AdS/CFT Duality Formalization:

The standard AdS/CFT relationship is generalized as:
ZCFT[J(x)]=ZAdS[ϕ(x,r)]
ZCFT​[J(x)]=ZAdS​[ϕ(x,r)]

where:

    ZCFT[J(x)]ZCFT​[J(x)]: Partition function of the conformal field theory on the boundary with source fields J(x)J(x).

    ZAdS[ϕ(x,r)]ZAdS​[ϕ(x,r)]: Partition function of gravitational bulk theory with bulk fields ϕ(x,r)ϕ(x,r).

In the RR-AdS/CFT, we introduced a dual symmetry explicitly incorporating retrocausal boundary conditions:
ZCausal/Retro[ψboundary(x,t)]=∫D[ϕ(x,r,t)]ei(Sbulk[ϕ(x,r,t)]+Sretrocausal[ψboundary(x,t)])
ZCausal/Retro​[ψboundary​(x,t)]=∫D[ϕ(x,r,t)]ei(Sbulk​[ϕ(x,r,t)]+Sretrocausal​[ψboundary​(x,t)])

Here:

    ψboundary(x,t)ψboundary​(x,t) explicitly encodes causal and retrocausal boundary conditions simultaneously.

    SbulkSbulk​ is the gravitational action (Einstein-Hilbert action + cosmological constant), governing bulk retrocausal propagation.

    SretrocausalSretrocausal​ explicitly couples the boundary CFT fields with retrocausal constraints, reflecting how retrocausality dynamically modifies observed physics at the boundary.

Explicit Mathematical Structure:

The bulk gravitational action explicitly includes retrocausal terms:
Sbulk[ϕ(x,r,t)]=116πG∫dD+1x −g(R−2Λ)+γ∫∂AdSdDx −h ϕ(x,rboundary,t)∂nϕ(x,rboundary,t)
Sbulk​[ϕ(x,r,t)]=16πG1​∫dD+1x−g
​(R−2Λ)+γ∫∂AdS​dDx−h
​ϕ(x,rboundary​,t)∂n​ϕ(x,rboundary​,t)

    RR: Ricci scalar, ΛΛ: cosmological constant, GG: gravitational constant.

    γγ: Coupling parameter encoding retrocausal boundary resonance.

    ∂n∂n​: Normal derivative at boundary rboundaryrboundary​.

The boundary action is modified by a retrocausal resonance term:
Sretrocausal[ψboundary(x,t)]=ϵ∫dDx dt −h ψboundary(x,t) ψboundary(x,−t)e−iωretrot
Sretrocausal​[ψboundary​(x,t)]=ϵ∫dDxdt−h
​ψboundary​(x,t)ψboundary​(x,−t)e−iωretro​t

    ϵϵ: Small coupling constant setting the strength of retrocausal resonance.

    ωretroωretro​: Resonant retrocausal frequency.

Physical Predictions (for empirical testing):

Black Hole Ringdown & Gravitational Waves (LIGO Data):

    Retrocausal effects emerge as subtle modifications in gravitational waveforms detectable as modulated echoes or anomalies during black hole mergers.

CMB Data:

    Holographic boundary resonances create unique patterns in low-ℓℓ CMB multipoles, correlating with holographic phase-shifts.

Quantum Experiments:

    Delayed-choice quantum experiments would reveal subtle retrocausal signatures due to boundary resonance predicted explicitly by RR-AdS/CFT formulation.

Benefits and Scientific Advantages:

    Integrates a rigorous holographic principle into Resonant Recursion.

    Provides clear mathematical testability within existing AdS/CFT research paradigms.

    Predicts empirical signatures directly observable with contemporary and near-future experimental data.
