Modified AdS/CFT with Retrocausal Shadows (RR-AdS/CFT)
Core Principle: Observational Incompleteness
The fundamental insight is that retrocausal effects cannot be directly observed by causally-bound observers. Instead, retrocausality manifests as systematic absences, interference patterns, and statistical voids in observable data.
Mathematical Framework
Modified Duality Mapping
The RR-AdS/CFT duality maps between:
Bulk AdS-like Space (Higher-dimensional):

Represents the complete causal-retrocausal dynamics
Contains both forward and backward propagating influences
Fundamentally inaccessible to direct observation

Boundary CFT-like Theory (Lower-dimensional):

Represents observable reality after retrocausal filtering
Contains only causally-accumulated information
Shows shadows and absences where retrocausal interference is destructive

Partition Function Formulation
The observable partition function is not the sum but the filtered product:
ZObservable[J(x)]=ZCausal[J(x)]×F[ZRetro[J(x)]]Z_{Observable}[J(x)] = Z_{Causal}[J(x)] \times \mathcal{F}[Z_{Retro}[J(x)]]ZObservable​[J(x)]=ZCausal​[J(x)]×F[ZRetro​[J(x)]]
where F\mathcal{F}
F is a filtering functional that creates destructive interference:

F[ZRetro]=∏x,t[1−∣⟨ψretro(x,t)∣ψcausal(x,t)⟩∣2]\mathcal{F}[Z_{Retro}] = \prod_{x,t} [1 - |\langle\psi_{retro}(x,t)|\psi_{causal}(x,t)\rangle|^2]F[ZRetro​]=x,t∏​[1−∣⟨ψretro​(x,t)∣ψcausal​(x,t)⟩∣2]
This ensures retrocausal effects appear as absences rather than additions.
Bulk Action with Shadow Terms
