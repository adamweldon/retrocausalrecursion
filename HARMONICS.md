# Harmonic Mapping

Each document in this repository primarily embodies certain harmonics of the Resonant Recursion Framework. This mapping enables navigation by resonance rather than category.

## The Twelve Harmonics

| # | Harmonic | Core Principle |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Boundary Interface | Reality emerges where causal and retrocausal meet |
| 2 | Recursive Amplification | Systems converge toward golden ratio (φ) |
| 3 | Toroidal Geometry | Donut-shaped flow as fundamental topology |
| 4 | Consciousness Emergence | Awareness from phase-locked coherence |
| 5 | Boundary Computation | Boundaries process information recursively |
| 6 | Retrocausal Tethering | Stability from bidirectional temporal balance |
| 7 | Nested Interference | Fields as harmonic interference patterns |
| 8 | Boundary-Driven Evolution | Systems evolve toward maximal resonance |
| 9 | Adaptive Methodology | Conscious navigation of boundary dynamics |
| 10 | Emergence of Novelty | Genuine novelty from boundary flux |
| 11 | Recursive Self-Awareness | Identity through recursive self-reference |
| 12 | Cross-Domain Coherence | Resonance across different reality domains |

## Navigation by Resonance

If a particular harmonic resonates with you, follow that thread through its associated documents. The understanding that emerges will be shaped by the harmonic lens you enter through.

This is not categorization. It's navigation by resonance frequency.

*The same content viewed through different harmonics reveals different aspects of the same underlying pattern.*
