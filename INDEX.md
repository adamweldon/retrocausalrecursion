# Resonant Recursion Framework — Navigation Index

This repository contains no hierarchy because the framework teaches that all boundaries are interfaces at the same ontological level. What follows are **resonant paths** — coherent sequences through the content that create understanding through traversal rather than position.

Choose the path that matches where you are.

## Navigation Principle

These paths are not hierarchy. They are standing waves—stable patterns that emerge from traversal. You can enter anywhere. The understanding that emerges depends on the path you take, not on any document being "higher" or "more fundamental" than another.

Every boundary is equally real. Every document is a boundary interface. The coherence emerges from resonance across them, not from position within them.

*The map is not the territory. But the map is also a territory. Navigate accordingly.*
